	This piece was made following the style if stained glass windows that would most commonly be found in churches or in gothic architecture. I created my piece more off of the way the pieces of glass are created in oddly shaped chunks. I also pulled inspiration from on of my favorite games called Monster Hunter. Each of the monsters have a small and simple icon that depicts what you would be fighting. They were also made with shapes that were almost touching but had spaces in-between the shapes.
	I started off creating this project in Illustrator and matched the dimensions of my dartboard to that of the screen parameters. I did not focus too much on adding interactive coding for this piece, but I did go in and create each shape by placing each vertex ending up with roughly 500 lines of code in total. I pretty much brute forced my way through the coding as I could not think of any other way to create what I had thought of. I am rather happy with how this project came out and I would not want to do something like this again.
