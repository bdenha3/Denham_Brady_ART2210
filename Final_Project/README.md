## Denham_Brady_ART2210 Final Project

The way this program works is to type in the corresponding number in the first box and hit submit.
Then find the category for the word you would like to show up, then type the number for that word in the box and then press the corresponding category button.
Finally, press the "Complete the Message" button and then the completed message will appear beneath the button.

This program will only work with a live server active.

## Designer_Statement

The main focus behind this project was to recreate the Dark Souls messaging system in the java script files. I used the Dark Souls json file that we used in another class session when we first were introduced to how to use a json file. This project was based off of my class work from that day and I made some good progress about how to work around the json files. I also included the use of interactive buttons through the use of the p5.dom library. While this was slightly difficult to understand at first, it became much more clearer to me as time went on.

I was interested in doing this project because I have always been interested in video games and when I saw that there was a json file that was connected to a game I enjoyed, I wanted to work on implementing it into my final project in some way. My first idea with this project was to somehow recreate the messaging system from this game in the java script and this appeared to be rather difficult at first. The main focus of this project to me was on the functionality of this project, not so much of the looks of it. I would like to eventually be able to work on video games later on in my life and career. I enjoyed working on this project as I troubleshooted what was going wrong in my file and when I finally had it all working, I felt a sense of accomplishment as I did not have to ask for much help on this. This feeling was only made greater as I have never had to do something quite like this for anything else I have worked on. One thing I feel worried about with this project is that it might not be that easy to understand at first, but Iâ€™m hoping that the directions that I have put in the README file and in the project will help out with that.
