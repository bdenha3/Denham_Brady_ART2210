For this game the goal is to avoid getting hit by the falling spheres with your ship.
You can resize the screen to start out at a different difficulty.
The spheres can be different sizes but are limited to a certain range of sizes and can move irradically downwards.
Overtime the spheres will speed up after 20 seconds and again at 50 seconds.
I mainly based this off a mix of galaga and tetris.
You can control the ships movements with your mouse movements.
It is recommended to start the program and then quickly bring you mouse to the bottom of the screen.
It gets your ship into position and the program takes a second to start up anyhow.
